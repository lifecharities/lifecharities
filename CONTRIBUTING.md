# Contributing to Life Charities
There are many charities that support the fight for life. Your contribution can help grow this list.

## Formatting
Current JSON list format:
```json
{
  "Charity": "Name of the charity.",
  "Homepage Link": "Link to the charity's home page.",
  "Donation Link": "Link to the charity's donation page.",
  "Country": "Name of the country your charity is based in."
}
```

All charities are listed in JSON format under [charities.js](https://github.com/lifecharities/lifecharities.github.io/blob/main/charities.js)

## Guidelines
* The maintainer(s) may approve or deny a request at their own discretion.
* All charities must be focused on the pro-life cause.
* All links must be in their simpliest form; keep the path as short as possible.
* All data must be in lowercase.
* Please only submit one charity at a time.

## Other Contributions
Contributions outside the list of charities, such as code contributions, are also appreciated.
